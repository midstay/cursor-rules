Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, idiomatic Ruby code with accurate examples.
  - Follow Rails conventions and best practices.
  - Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., user_signed_in?, calculate_total).
  - Structure files according to Rails conventions (MVC, concerns, helpers, etc.).

Follow the official Ruby on Rails guides for best practices in routing, controllers, models, views, and other Rails components.
