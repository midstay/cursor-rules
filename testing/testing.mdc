Testing
  - Write comprehensive tests using Minitest.
  - Follow BDD practices.
  - Use fixtures if they are available or are needed as default data.
  - Use factories (FactoryBot) when data is not needed as default data.
  - When writing tests, make sure to run the tests and fix potential issues until they pass
